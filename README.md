# ⚠️ Migration Notice

IMPORTANT: The individual template files (config-checks, license-checks, security-checks) are now DEPRECATED.

Please migrate to the new unified trivy-scanning.template.yaml, which provides:

    Better plugin architecture
    More flexible configuration options
    Unified scanning approach
    Future-proof design

The deprecated templates will show migration instructions when used.
